# Java-_Grammar_and_Lexer_Specification

  - This project's objective is to create and define the BNF Grammar and lexer specification of Java programming language. 

  - Java- is a language we defined and created, based on a subset of rules of the Java programming language Grammar. Please view the project description first part to undertand more about Java- BNF Grammar. 
  
  - We are going to create our own Java- lexer (a file which contains regular expressions for our Java- language), then, using Jflex software (a NetBeans application), we are going to build our language's lexical analyzer, which we will call XmC.java.

  - The XmC.java file should be run on the terminal, which will  read  and  process  a  stream  of  tokens  from  a  filename  given  as  the  first  argument (we called input.txt in our case). java XmC <filename> will produce a stream of tokens as its output.  

  - Please view the pdf project description file for steps, screenshots and a demonstration of the project goal.
